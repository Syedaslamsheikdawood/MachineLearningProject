# MachineLearningProject
The Boston Housing Dataset provides information about various factors affecting housing prices in Boston. This project aims at developing a machine learning model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on the provided features. This project focuses on predicting housing prices in various towns of Boston using regression analysis. The goal is to implement three distinct regression models—Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression, and Random Forest Regression—and evaluate their performance using Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-Squared Error. The objective is to discern the most effective model for accurately predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on the given dataset. This project delves into the exploration of three potent regression models—Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression, and Random Forest Regression aiming to unravel the intricate relationships between the features and the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV). Through the lens of regression analysis, we seek to analyse patterns, discern trends, and uncover insights. Our aim is to derive actionable insights that resonate with the pulse of Boston's housing market. Understanding the factors influencing housing prices can guide efforts to enhance economic opportunities, improve infrastructure, and foster a sustainable and inclusive environment.
